## Problem

Inability to get cheap, affordable, feel-at-home and secure accomodation for short stay
especially people visiting big cities like Lagos, Ibadan etc. for the first time

## Proposed Solution

A platform that allows home owners to offer rooms in their homes for short rent,
and get paid a token for it

## Proposed Stack

Node, ReactJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB (with MongoDB Atlas)

## Benefit

- To provide another source of income to home owners
- Provide secure and comfortable accomodation for people
